## Appendix A. CSF Core
This appendix describes the Functions, Categories, and Subcategories of the CSF Core. Table 1 lists the CSF 2.0 Core Function and Category names and unique alphabetic identifiers. Each Function name in the table is linked to its portion of the appendix. The order of Functions, Categories, and Subcategories of the Core is not alphabetical; it is intended to resonate most with those charged with operationalizing risk management within an organization.

The CSF Core, Informative References, and Implementation Examples are available on the CSF 2.0 website and through the CSF 2.0 Reference Tool, which allows users to explore them and export them in human- and machine-readable formats. The CSF 2.0 Core is also available in a legacy format similar to that of CSF 1.1.

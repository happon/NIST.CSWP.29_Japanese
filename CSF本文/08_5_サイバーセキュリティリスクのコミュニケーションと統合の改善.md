## 5. Improving Cybersecurity Risk Communication and Integration
The CSF’s use will vary based on an organization’s unique mission and risks. With an understanding of stakeholder expectations and risk appetite and tolerance (as outlined in GOVERN), an organization can prioritize cybersecurity activities to make informed decisions about cybersecurity expenditures and actions. An organization may choose to handle risk in one or more ways — including mitigating, transferring, avoiding, or accepting negative risks and realizing, sharing, enhancing, or accepting positive risks — depending on the potential impacts and likelihoods. Importantly, an organization can use the CSF both internally to manage its cybersecurity capabilities and externally to oversee or communicate with third parties.

Regardless of the CSF’s utilization, an organization may benefit from using the CSF as guidance to help it understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks and the actions that will manage those risks. The selected outcomes can be used to focus on and implement strategic decisions to improve cybersecurity postures and maintain continuity of missionessential functions while taking priorities and available resources into account.

### 5.1. Improving Risk Management Communication
The CSF provides a basis for improved communication regarding cybersecurity expectations, planning, and resources. The CSF fosters bidirectional information flow (as shown in the top half of Fig. 5) between executives who focus on the organization’s priorities and strategic direction and managers who manage specific cybersecurity risks that could affect the achievement of those priorities. The CSF also supports a similar flow (as shown in the bottom half of Fig. 5) between managers and the practitioners who implement and operate the technologies. The left side of the figure indicates the importance of practitioners sharing their updates, insights, and concerns with managers and executives.

Preparing to create and use Organizational Profiles involves gathering information about organizational priorities, resources, and risk direction from executives. Managers then collaborate with practitioners to communicate business needs and create risk-informed Organizational Profiles. Actions to close any gaps identified between the Current and Target Profiles will be implemented by managers and practitioners and will provide key inputs into system-level plans. As the target state is achieved throughout the organization — including through controls and monitoring applied at the system level — the updated results can be shared through risk registers and progress reports. As part of ongoing assessment, managers gain insights to make adjustments that further reduce potential harms and increase potential benefits. 

The GOVERN Function supports organizational risk communication with executives. Executives’ discussions involve strategy, particularly how cybersecurity-related uncertainties might affect the achievement of organizational objectives. These governance discussions support dialogue and agreement about risk management strategies (including cybersecurity supply chain risk); roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policies; and oversight. As executives establish cybersecurity priorities and objectives based on those needs, they communicate expectations about risk appetite, accountability, and resources. Executives are also responsible for integrating cybersecurity risk management with ERM programs and lower-level risk management programs (see Sec. 5.2). The communications reflected in the top half of Fig. 5 can include considerations for ERM and the lower-level programs and, thus, inform managers and practitioners.

The overall cybersecurity objectives set by executives are informed by and cascade to managers. In a commercial entity, these may apply to a line-of-business or operating division. For government entities, these may be division- or branch-level considerations. When implementing the CSF, managers will focus on how to achieve risk targets through common services, controls, and collaboration, as expressed in the Target Profile and improved through the actions being tracked in the action plan (e.g., risk register, risk detail report, POA&M). 

Practitioners focus on implementing the target state and measuring changes in operational risk to help plan, carry out, and monitor specific cybersecurity activities. As controls are implemented to manage risk at an acceptable level, practitioners provide managers and executives with the information (e.g., key performance indicators, key risk indicators) they need to understand the organization’s cybersecurity posture, make informed decisions, and maintain or adjust the risk strategy accordingly. Executives can also combine this cybersecurity risk data with information about other types of risk from across the organization. Updates to expectations and priorities are included in updated Organizational Profiles as the cycle repeats.

### 5.2. Improving Integration with Other Risk Management Programs
Every organization faces numerous types of ICT risk (e.g., privacy, supply chain, artificial intelligence) and may use frameworks and management tools that are specific to each risk. Some organizations integrate ICT and all other risk management efforts at a high level by using ERM, while others keep the efforts separate to ensure adequate attention on each. Small organizations by their nature may monitor risk at the enterprise level, while larger companies may maintain separate risk management efforts integrated into the ERM.

Organizations can employ an ERM approach to balance a portfolio of risk considerations, including cybersecurity, and make informed decisions. Executives receive significant input about current and planned risk activities as they integrate governance and risk strategies with results from previous uses of the CSF. The CSF helps organizations to translate their terminology for cybersecurity and cybersecurity risk management into general risk management language that executives will understand.

NIST resources that describe the mutual relationship between cybersecurity risk management and ERM include:

- NIST Interagency Report (IR) 8286, Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
- IR 8286A, Identifying and Estimating Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management
- IR 8286B, Prioritizing Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management
- IR 8286C, Staging Cybersecurity Risks for Enterprise Risk Management and Governance Oversight
- IR 8286D, Using Business Impact Analysis to Inform Risk Prioritization and Response

- SP 800-221A, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Risk Outcomes: Integrating ICT Risk Management Programs with the Enterprise Risk Portfolio

An organization may also find the CSF beneficial for integrating cybersecurity risk management with individual ICT risk management programs, such as: 

- Cybersecurity risk management and assessment: The CSF can be integrated with established cybersecurity risk management and assessment programs, such as SP 800- 37, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations, and SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments from the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). For an organization using the NIST RMF and its suite of publications, the CSF can be used to complement the RMF’s approach to selecting and prioritizing controls from SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations.
- Privacy risks: While cybersecurity and privacy are independent disciplines, their objectives overlap in certain circumstances, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Cybersecurity risk management is essential for addressing privacy risks related to the loss of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individuals’ data. For example, data breaches could lead to identity theft. However, privacy risks can also arise by means that are unrelated to cybersecurity incidents.  
An organization processes data to achieve mission or business purposes, which can sometimes give rise to privacy events whereby individuals may experience problems as a result of the data processing. These problems can be expressed in various ways, but NIST describes them as ranging from dignity-type effects (e.g., embarrassment or stigma) to more tangible harms (e.g., discrimination, economic loss, or physical harm). The NIST Privacy Framework and Cybersecurity Framework can be used together to address the different aspects of cybersecurity and privacy risks. Additionally, NIST’s Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM) has a catalog of example problems for use in privacy risk assessments.

- Supply chain risks: An organization can use the CSF to foster cybersecurity risk oversight and communications with stakeholders across supply chains. All types of technology rely on a complex, globally distributed, extensive, and interconnected supply chain ecosystem with geographically diverse routes and multiple levels of outsourcing. This ecosystem is composed of public- and private-sector entities (e.g., acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other technology-related service providers) that interact to research, develop, design, manufacture, acquire, deliver, integrate, operate, maintain, dispose of, and otherwise utilize or manage technology products and services. These interactions are shaped and influenced by technologies, laws, policies, procedures, and practices.  
Given the complex and interconnected relationships in this ecosystem, supply chain risk management (SCRM) is critical for organizations. Cybersecurity SCRM (C-SCRM) is a systematic process for managing exposure to cybersecurity risk throughout supply chains and developing appropriate response strategies, policies, processes, and procedures. The Subcategories within the CSF C-SCRM Category [GV.SC] provide a connection between outcomes that focus purely on cybersecurity and those that focus on C-SCRM. SP 800-161r1 (Revision 1), Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations, provides in-depth information on C-SCRM.

- Risks from emerging technologies: As new technologies and new applications of technology become available, new risks become clear. A contemporary example is artificial intelligence (AI), which has cybersecurity and privacy risks, as well as many other types of risk. The NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) was developed to help address these risks. Treating AI risks alongside other enterprise risks (e.g., financial, cybersecurity, reputational, and privacy) will yield a more integrated outcome and organizational efficiencies. Cybersecurity and privacy risk management considerations and approaches are applicable to the design, development, deployment, evaluation, and use of AI systems. The AI RMF Core uses Functions, Categories, and Subcategories to describe AI outcomes and help manage risks related to AI.

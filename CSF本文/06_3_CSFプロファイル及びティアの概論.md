## 3. Introduction to CSF Profiles and Tiers
This section defines the concepts of CSF Profiles and Tiers.

### 3.1. CSF Profiles
A CSF Organizational Profile describes an organization’s current and/or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the Core’s outcomes. Organizational Profiles are used to understand, tailor, assess, prioritize, and communicate the Core’s outcomes by considering an organization’s mission objectives, stakeholder expectations, threat landscape, and requirements. An organization can then prioritize its actions to achieve specific outcomes and communicate that information to stakeholders.

Every Organizational Profile includes one or both of the following: 

1. A Current Profile specifies the Core outcomes that an organization is currently achieving (or attempting to achieve) and characterizes how or to what extent each outcome is being achieved.

2. A Target Profile specifies the desired outcomes that an organization has selected and prioritized for achieving its cybersecurity risk management objectives. A Target Profile considers anticipated changes to the organization’s cybersecurity posture, such as new requirements, new technology adoption, and threat intelligence trends.

A Community Profile is a baseline of CSF outcomes that is created and published to address shared interests and goals among a number of organizations. A Community Profile is typically developed for a particular sector, subsector, technology, threat type, or other use case. An organization can use a Community Profile as the basis for its own Target Profile. Examples of Community Profiles can be found on the NIST CSF website. 

The steps shown in Fig. 3 and summarized below illustrate one way that an organization could use an Organizational Profile to help inform continuous improvement of its cybersecurity.

1. Scope the Organizational Profile. Document the high-level facts and assumptions on which the Profile will be based to define its scope. An organization can have as many Organizational Profiles as desired, each with a different scope. For example, a Profile could address an entire organization or be scoped to an organization’s financial systems or to countering ransomware threats and handling ransomware incidents involving those financial systems.
2. Gather the information needed to prepare the Organizational Profile. Examples of information may include organizational policies, risk management priorities and resources, enterprise risk profiles, business impact analysis (BIA) registers, cybersecurity requirements and standards followed by the organization, practices and tools (e.g., procedures and safeguards), and work roles.
3. Create the Organizational Profile. Determine what types of information the Profile should include for the selected CSF outcomes, and document the needed information. Consider the risk implications of the Current Profile to inform Target Profile planning and prioritization. Also, consider using a Community Profile as the basis for the Target Profile.
4. Analyze the gaps between the Current and Target Profiles, and create an action plan. Conduct a gap analysis to identify and analyze the differences between the Current and Target Profiles, and develop a prioritized action plan (e.g., risk register, risk detail report, Plan of Action and Milestones [POA&M]) to address those gaps.
5. Implement the action plan, and update the Organizational Profile. Follow the action plan to address the gaps and move the organization toward the Target Profile. An action plan may have an overall deadline or be ongoing.  

Given the importance of continual improvement, an organization can repeat these steps as often as needed.

There are additional uses for Organizational Profiles. For example, a Current Profile can be used to document and communicate the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and known opportunities for improvement with external stakeholders, such as business partners or prospective customers. Also, a Target Profile can help express the organization’s cybersecurity risk management requirements and expectations to suppliers, partners, and other third parties as a target for those parties to achieve. 

### 3.2. CSF Tiers
An organization can choose to use the Tiers to inform its Current and Target Profiles. Tiers characterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management practices, and they provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the processes in place to manage those risks. The Tiers, as shown in Fig. 4 and notionally illustrated in Appendix B, reflect an organization’s practices for managing cybersecurity risk as Partial (Tier 1), Risk Informed (Tier 2), Repeatable (Tier 3), and Adaptive (Tier 4). The Tiers describe a progression from informal, ad hoc responses to approaches that are agile, risk-informed, and continuously improving. Selecting Tiers helps set the overall tone for how an organization will manage its cybersecurity risks.

Tiers should complement an organization’s cybersecurity risk management methodology rather than replace it. For example, an organization can use the Tiers to communicate internally as a benchmark for an organization-wide1 1 For the purposes of this document, the terms “organization-wide” and “enterprise” have the same meaning. approach to managing cybersecurity risks. Progression to higher Tiers is encouraged when risks or mandates are greater or when a cost-benefit analysis indicates a feasible and cost-effective reduction of negative cybersecurity risks. 

The NIST CSF website provides additional information on using Profiles and Tiers. It includes pointers to NIST-hosted Organizational Profile templates and a repository of Community Profiles in a variety of machine-readable and human-usable formats.

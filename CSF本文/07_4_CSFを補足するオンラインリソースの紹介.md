## 4. Introduction to Online Resources That Supplement the CSF

NIST and other organizations have produced a suite of online resources that help organizations understand, adopt, and use the CSF. Since they are hosted online, these additional resources can be updated more frequently than this document, which is updated infrequently to provide stability to its users, and be available in machine-readable formats. This section provides an overview of three types of online resources: Informative References, Implementation Examples, and Quick Start Guides. 

Informative References are mappings that indicate relationships between the Core and various standards, guidelines, regulations, and other content. Informative References help inform how an organization may achieve the Core’s outcomes. Informative References can be sector- or technology-specific. They may be produced by NIST or another organization. Some Informative References are narrower in scope than a Subcategory. For example, a particular control from SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations, may be one of many references needed to achieve the outcome described in one Subcategory. Other Informative References may be higher-level, such as a requirement from a policy that partially addresses numerous Subcategories. When using the CSF, an organization can identify the most relevant Informative References.

Implementation Examples provide notional examples of concise, action-oriented steps to help achieve the outcomes of the Subcategories. Verbs used to express Examples include share, document, develop, perform, monitor, analyze, assess, and exercise. The Examples are not a comprehensive list of all actions that could be taken by an organization to achieve an outcome, nor do they represent a baseline of required actions to address cybersecurity risks.

Quick-Start Guides (QSGs) are brief documents on specific CSF-related topics and are often tailored to specific audiences. QSGs can help an organization implement the CSF because they distill specific portions of the CSF into actionable “first steps” that an organization can consider on the path to improving their cybersecurity posture and management of associated risks. The guides are revised in their own time frames, and new guides are added as needed. 

Suggestions for new Informative References for CSF 2.0 can always be shared with NIST at olir@nist.gov. Suggestions for other resources to reference on the NIST CSF website, including additional QSG topics, should be directed to cyberframework@nist.gov.

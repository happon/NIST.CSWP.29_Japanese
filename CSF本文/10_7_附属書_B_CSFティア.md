## Appendix B. CSF Tiers 
Table 2 contains a notional illustration of the CSF Tiers discussed in Sec. 3. The Tiers characterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance practices (GOVERN) and cybersecurity risk management practices (IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER).

|Tier|Cybersecurity Risk Governance|Cybersecurity Risk Management |
|---|---|---|
|Tier 1: <br>Partial|Application of the organizational  cybersecurity risk strategy is managed  in an ad hoc manner.<br>Prioritization is ad hoc and not  formally based on objectives or threat  environment. |There is limited awareness of cybersecurity risks at the  organizational level. <br>The organization implements cybersecurity risk  management on an irregular, case-by-case basis. <br>The organization may not have processes that enable  cybersecurity information to be shared within the  organization. <br>The organization is generally unaware of the  cybersecurity risks associated with its suppliers and the  products and services it acquires and uses.  |
|Tier 2:<br> Risk Informed  |Risk management practices are  approved by management but may  not be established as organization wide policy. <br>The prioritization of cybersecurity  activities and protection needs is  directly informed by organizational  risk objectives, the threat  environment, or business/mission  requirements.|There is an awareness of cybersecurity risks at the  organizational level, but an organization-wide approach  to managing cybersecurity risks has not been  established. <br>  Consideration of cybersecurity in organizational  objectives and programs may occur at some but not all  levels of the organization. Cyber risk assessment of  organizational and external assets occurs but is not  typically repeatable or reoccurring. <br>  Cybersecurity information is shared within the  organization on an informal basis. <br>  The organization is aware of the cybersecurity risks  associated with its suppliers and the products and  services it acquires and uses, but it does not act  consistently or formally in response to those risks. |
|Tier 3: <br>Repeatable|The organization’s risk management  practices are formally approved and  expressed as policy.  <br>  Risk-informed policies, processes, and  procedures are defined, implemented  as intended, and reviewed. <br>  Organizational cybersecurity practices  are regularly updated based on the  application of risk management  processes to changes in  business/mission requirements,  threats, and technological landscape. |There is an organization-wide approach to managing  cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity information is  routinely shared throughout the organization.  <br> Consistent methods are in place to respond effectively  to changes in risk. Personnel possess the knowledge and  skills to perform their appointed roles and  responsibilities.  <br>  The organization consistently and accurately monitors  the cybersecurity risks of assets. Senior cybersecurity  and non-cybersecurity executives communicate  regularly regarding cybersecurity risks. Executives  ensure that cybersecurity is considered through all lines  of operation in the organization. <br> The organization risk strategy is informed by the  cybersecurity risks associated with its suppliers and the  products and services it acquires and uses. Personnel  formally act upon those risks through mechanisms such  as written agreements to communicate baseline  requirements, governance structures (e.g., risk councils),  and policy implementation and monitoring. These  actions are implemented consistently and as intended  and are continuously monitored and reviewed. |
|Tier 4: <br>Adaptive| There is an organization-wide  approach to managing cybersecurity  risks that uses risk-informed policies,  processes, and procedures to address  potential cybersecurity events. The  relationship between cybersecurity  risks and organizational objectives is  clearly understood and considered  when making decisions. Executives  monitor cybersecurity risks in the  same context as financial and other  organizational risks. The organizational  budget is based on an understanding  of the current and predicted risk  environment and risk tolerance.  Business units implement executive  vision and analyze system-level risks in  the context of the organizational risk  tolerances. <br>Cybersecurity risk management is part  of the organizational culture. It  evolves from an awareness of previous  activities and continuous awareness of  activities on organizational systems  and networks. The organization can  quickly and efficiently account for  changes to business/mission  objectives in how risk is approached  and communicated. |The organization adapts its cybersecurity practices  based on previous and current cybersecurity activities,  including lessons learned and predictive indicators.  Through a process of continuous improvement that  incorporates advanced cybersecurity technologies and  practices, the organization actively adapts to a changing  technological landscape and responds in a timely and  effective manner to evolving, sophisticated threats. <br>The organization uses real-time or near real-time  information to understand and consistently act upon the  cybersecurity risks associated with its suppliers and the  products and services it acquires and uses. <br> Cybersecurity information is constantly shared throughout the organization and with authorized third parties. |

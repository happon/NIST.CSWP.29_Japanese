### Abstract
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks. It offers a taxonomy of highlevel cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization — regardless of its size, sector, or maturity — to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts. The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved. Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes. This document describes CSF 2.0, its components, and some of the many ways that it can be used.

### Audience
Individuals responsible for developing and leading cybersecurity programs are the primary audience for the CSF. The CSF can also be used by others involved in managing risk — including executives, boards of directors, acquisition professionals, technology professionals, risk managers, lawyers, human resources specialists, and cybersecurity and risk management auditors — to guide their cybersecurity-related decisions. Additionally, the CSF can be useful to those making and influencing policy (e.g., associations, professional organizations, regulators) who set and communicate priorities for cybersecurity risk management.

### Supplemental Content
NIST will continue to build and host additional resources to help organizations implement the CSF, including Quick Start Guides and Community Profiles. All resources are made publicly available on the NIST CSF website. Suggestions for additional resources to reference on the NIST CSF website can always be shared with NIST at cyberframework@nist.gov.

### Note to Readers
Unless otherwise noted, documents cited, referenced, or excerpted in this publication are not wholly incorporated into this publication.  
Before version 2.0, the Cybersecurity Framework was called the “Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.” This title is not used for CSF 2.0.  

### Acknowledgments
The CSF is the result of a multi-year collaborative effort across industry, academia, and government in the United States and around the world. NIST acknowledges and thanks all of those who have contributed to this revised CSF. Information on the CSF development process can be found on the NIST CSF website. Lessons learned about the use of the CSF can always be shared with NIST at cyberframework@nist.gov.
